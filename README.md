# Bash
My Bash configuration files - note some reside in /etc, others in ~

This repo includes many old files.  Much of the entries in these files need to be consolidated and/or sorted out of one file and into another (i.e. aliases).

It also includes the bash config files from my root account as that one needs to have a different colored prompt.
Recently I have not used fancy prompts, but do use different colors when operating at elevated privaleges.
